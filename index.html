                    Growing up, I visited Rocky Mountain National Park 
                    several times with my family. Oddly enough, 
                    I haven't been back as an adult, even though it's the 
                    closest park to home, however I do have good memories 
                    of exploring the park with my family and staying firmly
                    on the ground with my parents while my brother climbed
                    up the top of the waterfall.

                    My family and I stayed at Yellowstone for a week
                    over the 4th of July one summer. I was probably 
                    around twelve at the time but I have really clear
                    memories of this park--the stunning colors of 
                    some of the hot springs and the geysers like 
                    Old Faithful are really hard to forget. I really
                    want to go back there soon.

                    My family stopped at the Grand Canyon on the way 
                    to visit my grandfather in San Francisco. I'd like 
                    to go back and see it again.

                    I visited this park in 2013 with my boyfriend, 
                    Patrick. It was the first national park we visited 
                    together and got us really interested in visiting 
                    more of them. Now we try to visit at least one or
                    two a year. I'd love to go back to the sand dunes
                    again--they were amazing!

                    We visited Mesa Verde on the same trip as the 
                    Great Sand Dunes. This is a really interesting 
                    and unique park since the main feature is man-made 
                    instead of environmental. 
                    It's definitely worth a visit.

                    I first visited Arches in May of 2014 during a 
                    trip to Moab, Utah. It was amazing and is still 
                    my favorite park. My favorite hike is Devil's 
                    Garden--it's around 7 miles total and you get to 
                    see 6 or 7 arches during the hike, but what I love 
                    most are the views. You get to climb up giant
                    sandstone boulders and end up with amazing views 
                    of the park. We visited Arches again a couple of
                    years later and will definitely go back in the future.

                    We visited Canyonlands on the same trip to Moab. 
                    It is a huge park, and the first time we went we 
                    didn't get a chance to explore much of it, so what 
                    we saw was kind of underwhelming. The second time 
                    we visited Moab, however, we spent much more time
                    in Canyonlands, specifically in the "Islands in 
                    the Sky" section, and it was incredible.

                    We drove up to South Dakota to Badlands in 2015. 
                    To be honest, I found the park kind of disappointing. 
                    It was definitely a unique environment but kind of 
                    underwhelming compared to the parks in Utah.

                    Wind Cave is another park in South Dakota. 
                    We didn't know about it before our trip but
                    found out about when we were already in South 
                    Dakota. We opted to skip our second day at Badlands
                    and visit Wind Cave instead. It's a large cave 
                    system so we didn't get to explore much of it in 
                    just one day but it was great, and I'd really like 
                    to go back and see this one again if I'm ever in 
                    South Dakota.

                    This was a park I hadn't heard of until recently.
                    It's in western Colorado near Montrose. We visited
                    it in the summer in 2017 and it was beautiful! 
                    My favorite park was that it was not crowded at all. 
                    On one long hike we did we saw only one person 
                    and it was a park ranger.

                    Zion is probably the most beautiful of all of the
                    parks I've been to, but it was also the most 
                    crowded. I loved the park, but the hikes were so 
                    packed that it was at times hard to enjoy them.

                    Bryce Canyon was a really cool park as well-- 
                    we visited it on the same trip as Zion. 
                    It wasn't as pretty as Zion but it was much less 
                    crowded and had great hiking trails.
